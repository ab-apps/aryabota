# AryaBota
An app to teach Python coding, that gradually allows students to transition from using commands similar to natural language, to more Pythonic constructs.   
The experience is gamified through a visual component called AryaBota (AB) - a bot in a grid that navigates its way around obstacles.
This tool is still under development.

## Development
